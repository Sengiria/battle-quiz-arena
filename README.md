## 🧠 About the Game

In this fantasy-themed quiz challenge, you must answer a series of questions across 4 difficulty levels:

- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**
- **Hardcore**

Each level determines:
- How many questions you'll face.
- How much HP (health points) you have to endure wrong answers.

Your goal? Outlast the questions and destroy the castle!
